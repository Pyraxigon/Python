# Binary search

Have a list with numbers written out, split it, make it search for match with input. once it finds it, it halves the
'correct' half and searches the next new to halves and continues until it has isolated the exact number.

This was kind of similar to my number finder but with less random in it and finding exact numbers. I would say that this
is a MUCH faster way to do it however I liked the randomness of it.
    It also couldn't really .append for a list and repeat it for X times. I tried it and it broke the code. I am sure
    that there is a workaround for it however I got the main code working and could most likely copy the code I wrote
    for the number finder and tweak it a bit for a solve. I may do it in the future.

#Note I haven't watched a single video or guide through how to make it, only a video explaining what binary search is.
    This goes for all my projects.
