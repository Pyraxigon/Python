 SCRAPPED, maybe later??
# Can do a count for items in a list and then if user writes ( it keeps the other values still in there)




# Make it so input is NOT float so if person enters EMPTY it just resets

Make the show the stuff in 'sitting chair'??

(I wrote this in TxT mostly and i almost got it to work from there, lets fucking go)




# Make input NON float so we dont get error code from entering Space

# Make it so user can SELECT amount of Decimal places they want to recieve (Default = 3)

# Make a Settings Selection for the user.

# make a memory list, append.(list) then remove(0) and then input the new value at the front and make it printable.
# now that i have possibility to use letters without crashing the program i can use some letters to make the inputs more. or use 0 as a "list printer"
    # Now know how to do it, pop(0) (not remove lol) and .append(lisT) i can then make settings. ALSO need to figure out how to do + - / * in there to SHOW what happened.
            # Can do MULTIPLE appends' just one for each outcome


# Add a 'undo' to value 8 or something
    # X.pop(-1)
