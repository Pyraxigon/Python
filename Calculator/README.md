# Python

I am new to coding and wanted to get started a project so i setteled on a calculator. I started with simple + - * / and later made
more and more feature such as the 'brackets' Its not real brackets however it does a job kind of, as long as the user can use it efficently.

Later added the whole 'advanced' part just to try more stuff and making it have more usage and make it more efficent for a user and which later 2-3 days later 
i was starting to figure out how to do a 'history' list for the user to see all the previous inputs they did and that was probably one of the hardest ways as i struggeled
with making the 2d array well and make it be printed in ways i wanted. 

Generally happy and proud of my first ever project after having had very simple knowledge of python.
